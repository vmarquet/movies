All the beauty and the bloodshed
---


They had children
because it was expected,
more than it was about
nurturing other human beings.



It's a droll thing life is,
that mysterious arrangement
of merciless logic
for a futile purpose.
The most you can hope for
is some knowledge of yourself...
that comes too late...
A crop of unextinguishable regrets.
